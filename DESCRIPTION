Title: Stream Frame-Based Graphics from R via 'FFmpeg'

Description: Provides a minimal interface for streaming frame-based
    graphics generated in R to an external 'FFmpeg' process. Frames are
    pushed explicitly as RGBA pixel data, while video encoding and
    transport are handled by 'FFmpeg'. This enables publishing R-generated
    frames as video streams (e.g. via RTMP) or writing them to local video
    files, without implementing a rendering loop or video encoder in R.
