\title{periscope: Stream Frame-Based Graphics from R via 'FFmpeg'}
\description{
Provides a minimal interface for streaming frame-based graphics generated in R to an external 'FFmpeg' process. Frames are pushed explicitly as RGBA pixel data, while video encoding and transport are handled by 'FFmpeg'. This enables publishing R-generated frames as video streams (e.g. via RTMP) or writing them to local video files, without implementing a rendering loop or video encoder in R.
